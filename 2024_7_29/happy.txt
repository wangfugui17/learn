Thousands of people in Spain are protesting against mass tourism. In Barcelona, residents have sprayed tourists in restaurants with water guns. On the island of Mallorca, 10,000 people took to the streets holding banners that read: "Enough is enough!" and "Mallorca is not for sale." People in Mallorca are angry that their rents are increasing. It is becoming almost impossible for locals to buy a house because of tourism. Property prices are sky-high because companies are buying them to rent to tourists. A spokesperson for Airbnb said: "The people who work in the tourism industry can't afford the rent in their own city." She added: "We believe that basing the economy¡­on¡­tourism is unsustainable and has to change."

Residents in tourist areas have many complaints. They say tourism has a negative effect on their lives. Many can no longer find somewhere to live. Some have to move out of their homes because landlords are increasing rents. Daily life is also becoming a problem. Buses and trains are full of tourists with backpacks and suitcases. Towns are having problems keeping their streets clean. This is because of increasing litter. Local people also complain that they cannot eat at their favourite restaurants because of tourists. Spain is not the only country where tourism is becoming a problem. Japan, Austria and Mexico have acted to find a balance between helping local people and sustainable tourism.
